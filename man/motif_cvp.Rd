\title{Find consecutive but variable position (CVP) motif in a list of sequences}
\usage{
motif_cvp(seqs, min.seqs = 1, genes = NULL, ncores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqs}{a character vector of sequences}

\item{min.seqs}{minimum number of motif}

\item{genes}{the gene name from where a sequences is discovered, a character vector
has the same length as \code{seqs}}

\item{ncores}{the number of cores to be used, passed to \code{mclapply}.}
}
\value{
a list consists of:
  $mw - motif wise count, a names integer vector. The names are the sequence motifs and
  the integers indicate the frequency of each motifs in the input sequences.
  $gw - gene wise count, a list of two elements: 1) unique gene and 2) motif genes, i.e.
  genes include a specific type of motif
}
\description{
Find consecutive but variable position (CVP) motif in a list of sequences
}
\note{
the algorithm uses an exhaustive approach to find all consecutive
  motifs, so it could be slow when the number of sequences is large.
